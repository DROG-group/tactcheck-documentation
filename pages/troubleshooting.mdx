# Troubleshooting

Encountering issues while setting up or running TactCheck? Here are some common problems and their solutions.

## 1. Gamepatch Fails to Start

**Solution:** Ensure you have the correct Ruby and Rails versions installed. Check the `.env` file for missing or incorrect environment variables.

## 2. Express Backend Not Responding

**Solution:** Verify that the Express server is running and correctly configured. Check the logs for any errors related to missing dependencies or misconfigured routes.

## 3. Mastodon Integration Issues

**Solution:** Double-check the Mastodon customizations and ensure that the API modifications are correctly implemented. If Mastodon is not responding as expected, restart the service and review the logs.

## 4. Google Spreadsheet Not Syncing

**Solution:** Ensure your Google API credentials are correctly set up in the `.env` file and that the Google Spreadsheet ID is correct. Verify that the Gamepatch has the necessary permissions to access the spreadsheet.

If you continue to experience issues, please consult the [FAQ](/docs/faq) or reach out to the community for support.
