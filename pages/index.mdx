# Welcome to TactCheck

TactCheck, created by [DROG Group](https://drog.group), is an open-source project designed to simulate the dynamics of social media when used to spread propaganda, hoaxes, and disinformation. By leveraging Mastodon, we create a controlled environment to understand the impact of digital misinformation.
