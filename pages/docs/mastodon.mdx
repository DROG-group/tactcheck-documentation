# Mastodon Customizations

TactCheck requires specific modifications to Mastodon (Glitch Edition) to fully integrate with the Gamepatch system and simulate social media dynamics effectively.

## Customizations

- **API Modifications**: Adjustments to the Mastodon API to support automated posting and data retrieval.
- **UI Tweaks**: User interface customizations to reflect the simulation environment.
- **Security Enhancements**: Ensures that the simulated environment remains isolated and secure.

## Configuration

Detailed configuration settings are provided in the [setup instructions](/docs/setup). Ensure all changes are thoroughly tested in a controlled environment.

With these customizations, TactCheck can simulate complex social media interactions involving disinformation and propaganda.
