# Introduction to TactCheck

TactCheck is an open-source project developed by [DROG Group](https://drog.group) to simulate the dynamics of social media when used to spread propaganda, hoaxes, and disinformation. This project leverages tools like Gamepatch and Mastodon to create a controlled environment for studying the impact of digital misinformation.

## Why TactCheck?

With the rise of misinformation, understanding its spread and influence on social media platforms is crucial. TactCheck provides a sandbox for researchers, educators, and developers to explore these dynamics safely.
