# Setting Up TactCheck

Follow these instructions to set up TactCheck on your remote server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **NPM** or **Yarn**
- **Ruby** (v2.7 or higher)
- **Rails** (v6.0 or higher)
- **Mastodon** (Glitch Edition recommended)
- **Google Spreadsheet API** access

If you haven't installed Mastodon (Glitch Edition) yet, please refer to the [official Glitch Edition documentation](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/) for installation instructions.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone Repositories**:

   - Navigate to your Mastodon directory, typically located at `/home/{user}/live/`.
   - Clone the [Gamepatch Repository](/docs/gamepatch) inside the Mastodon directory. Gamepatch is built with Ruby on Rails:
     ```bash
     cd /home/{user}/live/
     git clone https://github.com/your-org/gamepatch.git
     ```
   - Clone the [Express Backend Repository](/docs/express) to your preferred location. The Express backend is built with Node.js:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-org/express-backend.git
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - For Gamepatch (Ruby on Rails):
     ```bash
     cd /home/{user}/live/gamepatch
     bundle install
     ```
   - For the Express backend (Node.js):
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/express-backend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Configure Mastodon**:

   - Update Mastodon settings according to the [Mastodon Customizations Guide](/docs/mastodon).

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in each repository and populate it with the necessary credentials and API keys.

5. **Run the Servers**:
   - Start the Gamepatch (Rails) server:
     ```bash
     rails server
     ```
   - Start the Express (Node.js) server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Next Steps

Once everything is set up, explore the [Gamepatch Overview](/docs/gamepatch) to learn how to inject conversations into Mastodon.
