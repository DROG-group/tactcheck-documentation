# Gamepatch Overview

Gamepatch is a custom system built with Ruby on Rails that injects simulated conversations into Mastodon. It plays a crucial role in the TactCheck project, enabling the simulation of social media dynamics, including the spread of propaganda, hoaxes, and disinformation.

## Features

- **Conversation Injection**: Automatically posts predefined conversations into Mastodon from a Google Spreadsheet.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Mastodon (Glitch Edition) to simulate real-world social media interactions.
- **Customization**: Easily configurable to support various themes and scenarios.

## Configuration

Gamepatch is located in the Mastodon directory at `/home/{user}/live/gamepatch`. Ensure all required environment variables are set correctly in the `.env` file.
