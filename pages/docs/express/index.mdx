# Express Backend

The Express backend is a Node.js application that acts as a bridge between the Gamepatch system and external inputs. It receives data from various sources, processes it, and forwards it to Gamepatch for injection into Mastodon.

## Key Features

- **API Gateway**: Exposes endpoints for interacting with the Gamepatch system.
- **Data Parsing**: Processes incoming data before passing it to the Gamepatch.
- **Modularity**: Can be extended to support additional data sources or processing logic.

## Configuration

The Express backend can be placed anywhere on your server. Make sure to set up environment variables in the `.env` file.

Next, learn about the [Mastodon customizations](/docs/mastodon) that make TactCheck possible.
